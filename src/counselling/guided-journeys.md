# Instructions

The following guided visualisations are intended to help you connect to what's most important to you in making an impact in your life. There are no right or wrong answers, only what's true for you.

In order to make the most of the exercise, it's important that you are able to listen free of distractions and that you give yourself as much time as you need to reflect on your answers. After listening to each recording, write down everything that comes to mind, using the questions as prompts. All of the spoken questions are written below, so don't worry about missing the questions while listening.

Close your eyes as you listen. Really take in each scenario and imagine being there.
