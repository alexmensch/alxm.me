Peter’s journey is one of grit, self-discovery, and courage. After years of overdelivering in high-pressure sales roles at tech companies like Dropbox, Slack, and various startups, he found himself trapped in the same painful pattern: hard work and results were met with doubt, misunderstanding, and missed recognition.

In this conversation, Peter shares how repeated setbacks - from being told he didn’t have “enough white hairs” to being offered roles that didn’t align with his passion — ultimately pushed him to bet on himself. He opens up about the toll that his sacrifices took on his health and personal life, how he processed grief after his sister’s death, and why he now leads with authenticity and vulnerability as his greatest assets.

Peter’s story is a testament to the power of listening to yourself, taking courageous risks, and pursuing work that's aligned with your core values.
