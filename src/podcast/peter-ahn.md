  Reproduced verbatim, this is an essay I wrote for my application to a psychotherapist training programme. I share it here not only because of the importance of normalising the struggles that many of us face in life, but also because I hope that it will give others the courage to do their own deep work.

If you had asked me five years ago about my childhood, I would have told you that it was happy, largely uneventful, and most notable for an international upbringing. The child of Mexican and American parents, born in Mexico with a few years spent in the US, I grew up in Spain and England from age 4 to 18. I attribute this background to my openness to new experiences and an ease with making friends. At home, my parents' relationship showed some signs of strain, but it was other families that had real problems. An only child, ever precocious, I seemed to have an instinct for performing well and pleasing my parents.
