Peter’s journey is one of grit, self-discovery, and courage. After years of overdelivering in high-pressure sales roles at companies like Dropbox, Slack, and a cybersecurity startup, he found himself facing the same painful pattern: hard work and results met with doubt, misunderstanding, and missed recognition.

In this episode, Peter shares how repeated corporate setbacks — from being told he didn’t have “enough white hairs” to being offered roles that didn’t align with his passion — ultimately pushed him to bet on himself. He opens up about the toll that sacrifice took on his health and personal life, how he processed grief after his sister’s death, and why he now leads with authenticity and vulnerability as his greatest assets.

We explore how he turned consulting “feelers” into a thriving coaching and personal brand, the conviction behind walking away from the safety of high-paying VP roles, and the power of showing up as your full self — even when it’s misunderstood at first.

Whether or not you’re in sales, Peter’s story is a testament to listening to your inner clarity, taking courageous risks, and creating work that finally feels in alignment with who you are.
