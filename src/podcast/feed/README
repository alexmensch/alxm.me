## Making updates to the podcast feed

**Artwork**

To update any artwork, you must change the filename of the artwork file in the feed in order for Apple Podcasts to pick up the change and update it in Podcasts for users.

**Changing publish dates or re-publishing episodes**

Once a GUID is assigned to an episode, it must never change. Podcast apps should check feeds regularly and update any metadata or changes associated with the same episode GUID.

**Publishing a new episode to the feed**

Checklist:

- Update RSS_LAST_MODIFIED in \_cloudflare/config.js with the date you make a change to the feed
- Set publishToRSSFeed to true in the episode(s)
- Check episode artwork path and file (itunes.image)
- Check audio path and file (recording)
- Build locally and check RSS feed
- Build & deploy public site
- Verify feed update in Apple Podcasts Connect
