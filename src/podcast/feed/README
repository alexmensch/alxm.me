## Making updates to the podcast feed

**Artwork**

To update any artwork, you must change the filename of the artwork file in the feed in order for Apple Podcasts to pick up the change and update it in Podcasts for users.

**Changing publish dates or re-publishing episodes**

The GUID assigned to the episode is what Apple uses to detect the "first appearance" of the episode. If you wish to re-launch it as a new episode, or update any of the metadata, you must change the GUID to force the change.

In order to republish an episode, change the GUID before Apple first picks it up in the public feed.

**Publishing a new episode to the feed**

Checklist:
- Update RSS_LAST_MODIFIED in \_cloudflare/config.js with the date you make a change to the feed
- Set publishToRSSFeed to true in the episode(s)
- Build locally and check RSS feed
- Build & deploy public site
- Verify feed update in Apple Podcasts Connect
