Lauren’s story is one of curiosity, courage, and self-discovery. After nearly ten years in a relationship that was increasingly out of alignment with her own growth, she faced a moment of mystical reckoning one afternoon that something had to change. Following her intuition, Lauren navigated a period of transition that involved changing nearly every aspect of her life.

She shares the emotional complexity of her breakup: both the mourning of what was lost, and the relief and freedom that came from returning to honouring her needs. She also explores the influence of family culture, early lessons about curiosity and self-knowledge, and how those foundations shaped her ability to embrace uncertainty and step fully into her potential.

Whether you’re facing a major life transition, questioning long-held commitments, or simply seeking inspiration to trust your intuition, Lauren’s story is a testament to leaning into resistance, honouring your inner voice, and embracing the unknown with curiosity and courage.
