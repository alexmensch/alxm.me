    The most important factor in the outcome of our work together is our relationship and the degree to which you can fully be yourself in the therapeutic space. Honouring this, I offer a free, no-commitment initial session to allow you to both see how I work and decide whether I am the right fit for you.<br/><br/>[Contact me](/contact) for a free initial consultation, and we can discuss your reasons for seeking support, your hopes for the future, and any questions you have.<br/><br/>Note that my work is not clinical psychotherapy or psychiatric in nature. If you are experiencing severe or persistent symptoms, I encourage you to contact your GP or the NHS by calling 111.

Hi, I'm [Alex](/about), and I work with anyone seeking to make meaningful changes in their life through understanding themselves more intimately.

Though I cannot promise any particular outcome, my experience is that everyone has a powerful and resourceful drive to fully become who they are. Working together, we will make contact with that spiritedness within you, and explore what may be getting in the way of its authentic expression.

My work with clients is relational, empathetic, and depth-oriented and is grounded in humanistic and existential schools of psychotherapy.

My calling to this work comes from my own experience of how transformative a therapeutic relationship was for me. Within the healing relational care of a therapist, I gradually rediscovered myself and found the courage to reshape my life and more authentically express who I am. I find it profoundly humbling and meaningful to walk alongside others as they follow what emerges from this type of deep inquiry.

## How we will work together

{% blockQuote "Carl Rogers", "On Becoming a Person", "https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Becoming-Person-Rogers-Carl-Constable/16269127392/bd" %}[…] we cannot change, we cannot move away from what we are, until we thoroughly _accept_ what we are. Then change seems to come about almost unnoticed.{% endblockQuote %}

Through the care of an unconditionally accepting relationship, you have the capacity to make contact with an inner wisdom that you can learn to trust as your guide. My role in our therapeutic relationship is not to advise or direct, but rather to gently walk beside you, encouraging you to make contact with a wholeness that is already there.

The path to authenticity starts with bringing [awareness](/writing/2024/07/02/seeing-things-clearly/) to the layers of beliefs and emotional patterns that shape your sense of Self. By bringing awareness to the unconscious scripts that you follow and the lenses that shape your experiences, you have the agency to make different choices. It is through new choices that growth and change emerge.

In our work together, I will support you in this self-exploration by encouraging your awareness and curiosity in the present moment to what it is like to be _you_, whether those aspects are familiar, uncomfortable, protected, or denied. We may do this through listening to your body somatically, showing compassion to parts of Self through internal family systems (IFS) work, revisiting the meaning of prior experiences, or expressing held emotions.

Though there is no time commitment, I generally work with people over a longer-term relationship, which honours the space and time that this potentially life-changing work can require. Sessions are held weekly over Zoom.

## Getting started

Whether you have a sense of what you want to work on, a general sense that something isn't right, or are navigating a challenging event or life transition, these are all fruitful starting points for our work together. We'll always start our work together from exactly where you are right now.

The following are common starting points for therapeutic work:

- Anxiety and stress during a major career, relationship, geographic, or cultural change
- Loneliness or disconnection from your day to day, as if you’re just going through the motions
- Dissatisfaction with important or significant relationships, whether personal or professional
- Emotional patterns in relationship with yourself or others that feel like they're getting in the way
- Seeking greater meaning from life or wanting to change a feeling of being stuck
- A feeling that something just doesn’t feel right; that change could lead to greater fulfillment

Times of significant personal change can often bring to the foreground existing painful or difficult patterns that get in the way of living the life that you desire. Like silt stirred up from the bottom of a still lake, it can be disorienting to navigate these transitions without unconditional support. Approached with courage, these are fertile opportunities for growth.

If you have a sense that your inner spirit is denied, you may recognise anxiety, stress, dysphoria, and anger amongst a range of emotions that can point to what needs attention in your life. It is through an unconditional and supportive therapeutic relationship that this aliveness within you can unfold.
