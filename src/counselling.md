Hi, I’m [Alex](/about), and I support clients in depth-oriented personal exploration and meaningful life change.

My calling to this work comes from my own experience of how transformative a therapeutic relationship was for me. Within the healing relational care of a therapist, I gradually rediscovered myself and found the courage to reshape my life to be in tune with who I am.

My belief and experience are that everyone has an innate impulse towards wholeness, and that an unconditional and supportive relationship creates a powerful space for this impulse to unfold. I find it profoundly humbling and meaningful to walk alongside my clients as they follow what emerges from this type of deep inquiry.

I offer depth-oriented therapeutic work informed by [existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_therapy) and [humanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology#Counseling_and_therapy) psychotherapy, and my work is supported by regular supervision with a qualified psychotherapist. I am a trained [Co-Active](https://coactive.com) coach, and I am currently completing a Master's degree in Humanistic Psychotherapy at the [Metanoia Institute](https://www.metanoia.ac.uk) in London.

## Authenticity and self-inquiry

{% blockQuote "Carl Rogers", "On Becoming a Person", "https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Becoming-Person-Rogers-Carl-Constable/16269127392/bd" %}[…] we cannot change, we cannot move away from what we are, until we thoroughly _accept_ what we are. Then change seems to come about almost unnoticed.{% endblockQuote %}

We are all in constant negotiation between authentic self-expression and the security of social belonging that comes from conformity. When there is a large enough disconnect between these two forces, we can feel unfulfilled, lost, or be constantly seeking without satisfaction. This can manifest across any of the dimensions of our lives, from family to career to relationships.

Moving towards a more authentic version of yourself starts with bringing awareness to the many layers of beliefs and emotional patterns that inform how you build your subjective reality. By getting to know the unconscious scripts you follow and the lenses that shape your experiences, you can start to make different choices. It is through new choices that fundamental change can take place.

Honestly examining your life through compassionate curiosity is one of the greatest gifts that you can give yourself. The reward for this act of self-love and courage may not only be greater self-actualization, but also more harmonious relationships with others.

## Are we a fit?

I work with anyone who is dedicated to pursuing what it means to live a life true to themselves. This often comes up during times of significant personal change that can be disorienting to navigate without unconditional support. The following are common starting points for my clients:

- Support during a major career, relationship, geographic, or cultural change
- Disconnection from your day to day, as if you’re just going through the motions
- Dissatisfaction with important or significant relationships, whether personal or professional
- Seeking greater meaning from life or wanting to change a feeling of being stuck
- A feeling that something just doesn’t feel right; that change could lead to greater fulfillment

Note that my work is not clinical psychotherapy or mental health treatment. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical or psychological condition. If you are experiencing severe or persistent symptoms, I encourage you to consult with an accredited [mental health professional](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk).

## How I work with my clients



I believe that through the power of a supportive and unconditional relationship, everyone has the capacity to make contact with an inner wisdom that they can learn to trust and guide them.

My role is to support you as you bring awareness to the patterns that shape your reality, gradually allowing a deeper, more authentic self to emerge.

I do this via an integral approach, which means giving consideration to how your body, heart (emotions), and mind communicate with you as a whole person. The only agenda I hold is yours, and clients are often surprised at the clarity that already exists within them, waiting to be heard.
