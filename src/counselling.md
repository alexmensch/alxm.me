    The most important factor in the outcome of our work together is our relationship. More important than any particular therapeutic approach is the degree to which you can fully be yourself in the relational space. Honouring this, I offer a free, no-commitment initial session to allow you to both see how I work and decide whether I am the right fit for you.<br/><br/>[Contact me](/contact) for a free initial consultation, and we can discuss your reasons for seeking support and your hopes for the future. I can also answer any questions you may have about myself and my approach.

Hi, I'm [Alex](/about), and I work with anyone seeking to make meaningful changes in their life through understanding themselves more intimately.

My calling to this work comes from my own experience of how transformative a therapeutic relationship was for me. Within the healing relational care of a therapist, I gradually rediscovered myself and found the courage to reshape my life to be in tune with who I am.

My experience is that we all have a powerful and resourceful drive to fully become who we are. When our inner spirit is denied, this can manifest as anxiety, stress, dysphoria, and anger amongst a range of emotions that can point us to what needs attention in our lives. It is through an unconditional and supportive relationship that this aliveness within us can unfold. I find it profoundly humbling and meaningful to walk alongside my clients as they follow what emerges from this type of deep inquiry.

I offer depth-oriented therapeutic work informed by [existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_therapy) and [humanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology#Counseling_and_therapy) psychotherapy, and my work is supported by regular supervision with an experienced psychotherapist.

## How I work with my clients

{% blockQuote "Carl Rogers", "On Becoming a Person", "https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Becoming-Person-Rogers-Carl-Constable/16269127392/bd" %}[…] we cannot change, we cannot move away from what we are, until we thoroughly _accept_ what we are. Then change seems to come about almost unnoticed.{% endblockQuote %}

I believe that through the power of a caring and unconditional relationship, everyone has the capacity to make contact with an inner wisdom that they can learn to trust as their guide. Living an authentic life starts with bringing awareness to the layers of beliefs and emotional patterns that shape your sense of self. By becoming aware of the unconscious scripts that you follow and the lenses that shape your experiences, you can start to make different choices. It is through new choices that fundamental change can take place.

My role in our therapeutic relationship is to hold the unconditional space for your encounters with these layers of self. I will support you in this self-exploration by encouraging you to bring awareness to the present moment of what it is like to be _you_, whether familiar or uncomfortable. As you integrate what your body (soma), heart (emotions), mind, and spirit are telling you within a safe relational space, you have the opportunity to develop greater compassion for both yourself and others.

I generally work with people over a longer-term relationship, which honours the space and time that this potentially life-changing work can require. Sessions are weekly over Zoom with no advance commitment.

## Are we a fit?

We are all in constant negotiation between authentic self-expression and the security of social belonging that comes from conformity. When there is a large enough disconnect between these two forces, we can feel unfulfilled, anxious, lonely, or be constantly seeking without satisfaction. This can manifest across any of the dimensions of our lives, from family to career to relationships.

I often begin work with people during times of significant personal change that can be disorienting to navigate without unconditional support. The disruption of change can often bring forwards old, painful patterns, like silt stirred up from the bottom of a still lake. Approached with courage, these are fertile opportunities for growth.

The following are examples of common starting points:

- Anxiety and stress during a major career, relationship, geographic, or cultural change
- Loneliness or disconnection from your day to day, as if you’re just going through the motions
- Dissatisfaction with important or significant relationships, whether personal or professional
- Seeking greater meaning from life or wanting to change a feeling of being stuck
- A feeling that something just doesn’t feel right; that change could lead to greater fulfillment

Note that my work is not clinical psychotherapy or mental health treatment. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical or psychological condition. If you are experiencing severe or persistent symptoms, I encourage you to consult with a [mental health professional](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk).
