  Awareness is a foundational skill for any type of self-development work. I describe how you can
  start to see things more clearly by shifting your perspective of others' actions. With
  practice and time, this can transform your relationship with both yourself and the people around you.

Bringing more awareness into your perceived reality is one of the most powerful things that you can do. It’s a foundational skill to unlocking personal growth and improving the quality of your relationships, including the relationship you have with yourself. Learning to notice and pay closer attention to what is happening allows you to adopt a more honest viewpoint, and it’s from honesty that truly enduring growth and change can emerge. What it requires is lots of curiosity and some bravery. Whether you decide to take action on your increased awareness is up to you, but I hope that I will convince you why you should.

This is a difficult topic to cover in an essay because the first step you need to take to improve _self_-awareness can feel very unnatural: you need to accept that you are not always consciously aware of why you do what you do. Since we all have the subjective experience of consciousness that we experience as being in the “driver’s seat”, the idea that we’re not in 100% control of ourselves at all times may sound preposterous. If you have experience with mindfulness, meditation, therapy, psychological concepts or Buddhism, then this concept may be more familiar to you, but it can still be difficult to wrap your head around, let alone practice it.

To ease into this idea, I’m going to start by approaching increased awareness of other people first. I’ll then shift the frame of reference to yourself, where the same concepts will apply, even if the practice is different. I’m also deliberately choosing to avoid delving deeply into theory or research and will instead take an experiential line of argument.^[The theoretical underpinnings are fascinating, though, and I encourage you to read more if you’re curious.] Take my word for it that this area has a significant body of scientific research and empirical evidence—not to mention several millennia of spiritual practice—supporting the arguments that I’ll make.

Let’s begin with something we’re all much more familiar with: observing, evaluating, and reacting to other people’s behavior. Consider how many of these types of scenarios are familiar in your experience:
- A family member who refuses the advice and pleading from loved ones to see a doctor for a health condition that could have serious consequences if left undiagnosed.
- A close friend who confides the frequent misery that a romantic relationship is causing them but chooses to excuse or tolerate their partner’s behavior because the prospect of dating and finding a new partner involves too much uncertainty.
- The business leader who appears to acknowledge troubling patterns (missed targets, high employee attrition, etc.) but avoids honestly evaluating the role they play in the outcomes.
- The product manager who prefers to design products based on how users _should_ behave rather than how they actually behave, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

These examples all demonstrate important commonalities. First, it’s much easier to give an objective evaluation of someone else’s situation rather than our own role and involvement in a situation. If you’ve ever asked a friend for advice or support in grappling with a difficult decision, you already intuitively know how indispensable this difference in perspective is. The implicit acknowledgment here is that there are often times when we already accept that our own judgement can be biased, imprecise, or incomplete.

Secondly, _every situation above is the result of a choice_. It is critical to realize this because it allows you to open up both your own and others’ actions to greater curiosity and inspection. Rather than seeing the outcome of someone’s behavior as a pure reflection of their intent, you can begin to understand their behavior more deeply by being curious about the choice they made. It is through this exploration that the opportunity to bring deeper compassion for others emerges. This also creates the option to change behavior by accepting it and working with where it’s coming from. If you can see that this is true for others, then you have the opportunity to see this in the choices made behind your own actions.

Lastly, there’s nothing objectively right or wrong about the behaviors in the example scenarios above. The behaviors are neutral in themselves, and it is in our role as an observer that we apply a layer of judgement on top of what we perceive. Though it may seem obvious to point this out, this can be extremely difficult to accept when we apply it to our own experience. For example, it’s easy (I hope!) to accept that there is no objectively “right” choice of favorite color. It’s harder to accept that other people can have wildly different political beliefs without labeling others as “wrong”. It’s harder still to accept that there is no inherent “wrong” assigned to a partner’s infidelity in a relationship.^[I’ll posit that the closer we get to what feels like a moral transgression, by definition an objective right or wrong, the more difficult it is for us to view an action with detachment. But we'll leave that question to psychology and philosophy.] The reason that it’s important to pay attention to this is that when we judge a situation as right or wrong, we completely block our ability to see things clearly.

I need to mention that not judging behavior is not the same as tolerating or endorsing someone else’s hurtful behavior. It’s about making a choice about how you react from a position of clarity. In responding to your partner’s infidelity, say, you might choose to end the relationship without further discussion, engage in a vitriolic fight that tears down their character, or try to understand why they acted the way they did with or without the goal of repairing the relationship. These are all potential choices, but some are going to be more productive than others. If you do decide to try to understand their behavior, it’s a guarantee that judging their behavior as “wrong” will prevent you from getting the clearest possible understanding of why they acted the way they did. This is different from communicating that their behavior was hurtful, handling the feelings that resulted from discovering their infidelity, or deciding that leaving the relationship is the best thing for you. I didn’t say that any of this was easy!

Before I move on to apply this same line of thinking to self-awareness, let’s run through the first example in the list above to see how this works. The outcome of the family member’s actions may seem frustrating, baffling, hurtful, or inconsiderate from your perspective if you only consider the result of their decision. But if we set aside the behavioral outcome, what if you instead open yourself up to being curious about what’s happening for that person and what influenced their _choice_ to not see a doctor? Your curiosity about the person’s choice creates a wide open set of possibilities that, beyond leading to more profound understanding, allows you to feel compassion and empathy for why they made the choice they did.^[This is what psychology refers to as [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), which is our ability to connect actions to the internal motivations of others. The better we know someone, the more refined our theory of mind is for them. This reinforces why getting curious and understanding someone’s choices better creates a deeper relationship with that person.]

The reasons behind their choice could be as varied as people are individual: they had a traumatic medical experience in the past; they fear facing the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and would rather pretend it doesn’t exist; they adore the attention their potential illness has created from others; or a million other nuanced reasons specific to that person’s life experiences. Anything is possible! You can only begin to understand why they made their choice, and understand that person’s behavior more clearly and objectively, if you choose to find out.

Lastly, judgment has no place in this process, and it’s very important that you set it aside. It may feel irresistible to label the outcome of this person’s behavior as “wrong” from the standpoint of the potential harm they’re doing to themselves, but this will actively block you from expanding your awareness. Instead, engage your curiosity and openness, and ask yourself what might be going on for the other person. Let’s say that you find out that this person does indeed adore the attention that their potential illness has attracted from others, despite the possibility of a grim prognosis. You’re now in a completely different territory that invites care and concern for whether they may have been feeling lonely or lacking the social support they wish they had. Even if you _aren't_ able to learn what is behind their choice, simply being aware that there are many possibilities is a step forwards.

Take a moment to consider the huge leap we’ve made in the last few paragraphs. We’ve gone from exasperation and negative judgement to a place of care and concern, simply by showing curiosity about someone’s choice. Choosing to expand our awareness has led to the possibility for empathy, compassion, and a softening towards someone’s behavior. This is an emotional space that growth, change, and deepening of relationships all thrive in, and it’s incredibly powerful.

At this point I’m hoping that it’s starting to become clear how you might apply this same approach to your own behaviors and actions. By allowing yourself to open up your self-awareness you create the conditions for growth and evolution. If you feel resistance to this idea and feel compelled to tell me that you already know exactly why you do what you do, that’s your ego speaking. We’ll get to that shortly.

I’ll start the perspective shift from understanding other people’s behavior to understanding your own behavior by reproducing a table from _[The Gift of Therapy](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780749923730/Gift-Therapy-open-letter-new-0749923733/plp)_ by Irvin D. Yalom, which efficiently illustrates our relationship to self-awareness.

|                       | Known to Self | Unknown to Self |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Known to Others**   | Public        | Blind           |
| **Unknown to Others** | Secret        | Unconscious     |

The proportions between the four quadrants are different for everyone, but if your goal is to increase your self-awareness, you must accept that there are parts of yourself that you are not yet aware of. I’m going to repeat that for emphasis: you are not fully aware of your entire self.

There’s no need to panic, however, and it may even bring you comfort to know that this is everyone’s experience. It’s a lifelong practice to get to know yourself. Depending on your goals, you might choose to make the unconscious quadrant smaller through, say, therapy, or tackle the blind quadrant by asking for feedback on your behavior from a close friend or colleague. The general insight that I hope this opens up is that _by definition_ our existence is one of imperfect self-awareness and knowledge. We are always presented with opportunities to be curious, ask why, and get to know ourselves a little better.

Before I go into how to put all of this into practice, you should know about another barrier to improved self-awareness. In general, more than 50% of people believe that they are above average, which is of course impossible. It’s been further shown that the _worse_ someone is at a particular skill, the more they tend to overrate their competence in that same skill.^[These are respectively known as [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) and the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). There is no strong agreement on exactly why people behave this way, so for our purposes we can accept it as an empirical reality.] The broader consequences of this in modern society should be clear, but more importantly, I point this out because it’s likely that your own self-awareness is lower than you think it is, _especially_ if you believe that you already possess a high level of self-awareness!

If you feel resistance to the ideas you’ve been reading about in the last few paragraphs on self-awareness, that’s entirely understandable and expected. I’m approaching a subject that’s inherently threatening to your ego: your concept of who you are. The idea of “ego” is colloquially equated to arrogance or self-importance, but you can more precisely think about your ego as a collection of beliefs about yourself. This unique set of beliefs is what you consider to be “you” and is the basis of your identity. I use the word “beliefs” very deliberately because that is what they are: ideas that you choose to believe, both consciously and unconsciously.^[I’m going to side-step the mind-bending philosophical argument here, which is that if what you think of as “you” is just a set of beliefs, then who is the “you” without the beliefs? We’re sticking to the empirical realm here, and this concept of ego-as-beliefs holds true.] These ideas can be relatively simple (“I am reliable”, “I am generous”, “I don’t cry in public”) to more complex (what you believe it means to lead a good life, what roles you believe each gender should play in society), but however they are represented within us, the sum of these beliefs represent our model of who we believe we are in the world.

By questioning your level of self-awareness, you’re questioning the accuracy and basis of your self-beliefs, which in turn starts to threaten your sense of identity. The thought that you might not fully understand or be aware of who you think you are is uncomfortable for anyone. The ego’s response to this threat to your identity is to be highly self-protective. Thoughts or experiences that threaten the ego’s system of self-belief set off alarm bells. Your ego responds by springing into action with a range of counter-thoughts that seek to reinforce who you _already believe you are_ and reject anything that undermines that.

The simplest of these defenses is to reject contradictory information (“they’re wrong”, “they’re just trying to hurt me”), but our defenses can be remarkably complex and nuanced, often operating at an unconscious level. This is why improving self-awareness can be such a challenging process. Your sense of identity is intrinsically resistant to any change, making it a very unwilling partner to self-discovery. If you choose to do the work of becoming more self-aware, you’ll need to learn to embrace that irony.
