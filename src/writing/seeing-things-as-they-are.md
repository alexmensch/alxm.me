_Awareness is such a critical prerequisite skill to any area of self-development that, even in this era of short attention spans, I’ve written a significant number of words on the subject. I’ll refer to this essay in other explorations of the self, so I can promise that reading this will be a valuable way to spend 10 minutes._

I’m going to start with a bold claim that I aim to convince you of by the end of this essay: bringing full awareness to your perceived reality is the key to unlocking any personal growth, improving the quality of your relationships, and bringing more satisfaction to your life. It requires a degree of continual practice and honesty with yourself that most of us are not accustomed to, but the good news is that each incremental step is rewarding, and it’s within everyone’s reach. What it mostly requires is bravery.

This can be a difficult topic to cover because if I ask you whether you are aware of your reality, your immediate answer is likely to be, “Of course!” with surprise at the question itself. If you have experience with meditation, mindfulness, psychology, therapy, or Buddhism, then this question may be less surprising to you, but the concept itself can still be difficult to wrap your head around. I’m going to approach supporting my claim with minimal reference to these other well-known practices and areas, and instead take an experiential line of argument. For those of you who are more scientifically minded, know that this entire area has a significant and increasing body of research supporting the arguments that I’m making here.

Let’s start with something we’re all much more familiar with: observing and evaluating other people’s behavior. Consider how many of these types of scenarios are familiar in your experience:
- A family member who refuses the advice and pleading from loved ones to see a doctor for a health condition that could have serious consequences if left undiagnosed.
- A close friend who confides the frequent misery that a romantic relationship is causing them but chooses to excuse their partner’s behavior because dating and finding a new partner involves so much uncertainty.
- The business leader who appears to acknowledge troubling patterns (missed targets, high employee attrition, etc.) but avoids honestly evaluating the role they play in the outcomes.
- The product manager who prefers to design products based on how users _should_ behave rather than how they actually behave, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

These examples all demonstrate important commonalities that are worth expanding on. First, it’s much easier to give an objective evaluation of someone else’s situation rather than our own role and involvement in a situation. If you’ve ever asked a friend for advice or support in grappling with a difficult decision, you already intuitively know how indispensable this difference in perspective is. The implicit acknowledgment here is that there are often times when we already accept that our own judgement can be biased, imprecise, or incomplete.

Secondly, _every situation above is the result of a choice_. It is critical to realize this because it allows you to open up your and others’ actions to greater curiosity and inspection. Rather than seeing the outcome of someone’s behavior as a pure reflection of their intent, you can begin to understand their behavior more deeply by being curious about the choice they made. It is through this exploration that the opportunity to bring deeper compassion for others emerges. This also creates the option to change behavior by accepting it and working with where it’s coming from. If you can see that this is true for others, then you can start to see this in your choices behind your actions.

Lastly, there’s nothing objectively right or wrong about the behaviors in the example scenarios above. The behaviors are neutral in themselves, and it is in our role as an observer that we apply a layer of judgement on top of what we perceive. Though it may seem obvious to point this out, this can be extremely difficult to accept when we apply it to our own experience. For example, it’s easy (I hope!) to accept that there is no objectively “right” favorite color. It’s harder to accept that other people can have wildly different political beliefs without labeling them as “wrong”. It’s probably harder still to accept that there is no inherent “wrong” assigned to a partner’s infidelity in a relationship.[^1](# "I’ll posit that the closer we get to what feels like a moral transgression, by definition an objective right or wrong, the more difficult it is for us to view an action with detachment. But we'll leave grappling with this question to the psychologists and philosophers.") The reason that it’s important to pay attention to this is that when we judge a situation as right or wrong, we lose our ability to see things clearly. If we can withdraw judgement of others’ actions, and seek to see things clearly, we also stand a chance of accepting and understanding our own actions without judgement.

I need to mention that not judging behavior is not the same as tolerating or endorsing someone else’s hurtful behavior. It’s about making a choice about how you react from a position of clarity. In responding to your partner’s infidelity, say, you might choose to end the relationship without further discussion, engage in a vitriolic fight that tears down their character, or try to understand why they acted the way they did with the goal of repairing the relationship. These are all potential choices, but some may be more productive than others. If you do decide to try to understand their behavior, it’s a guarantee that judging their behavior as “wrong” will prevent you from getting the clearest possible understanding of why they acted the way they did. This is different from communicating that their behavior was hurtful or handling the feelings that resulted from discovering their infidelity. I didn’t say that any of this was easy!

Before I move on to apply this same line of thinking to our own behavior, let’s run through the first example in the list above to see how this works. The outcome of the family member’s actions may seem frustrating, baffling, hurtful, or inconsiderate from your perspective if you only consider the result of their decision. But if we set aside the behavioral outcome, what if we instead open ourselves up to being curious about what’s happening for that person and what influenced their _choice_ to not see a doctor? Our curiosity about the person’s choice creates a wide open set of possibilities that, beyond leading to more profound understanding, may allow us to feel compassion and empathy for why they made the choice they did.[^2](# "This is what psychology refers to as [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), which is our ability to connect actions to the internal motivations of others.") The reasons behind their choice could be as varied as people are individual: they had a traumatic experience with a doctor in the past; they fear facing the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness; they adore the attention their potential illness has created from others; or a million other nuanced reasons specific to that person’s life experiences. Anything is possible! And we can only know what the answer is, and understand that person’s behavior more clearly and objectively, if we choose to find out.

By now, I’m hoping that it’s starting to become clear how you might apply this same approach to your own behaviors and actions. If you feel resistance to this idea and feel compelled to tell me that you already know exactly why you do what you do, that’s your ego speaking. We’ll get to that shortly.

I’ll start the perspective shift from understanding other people’s behaviors to understanding your own behavior by reproducing a table from _[The Gift of Therapy](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780749923730/Gift-Therapy-open-letter-new-0749923733/plp)_ by Irvin D. Yalom.

|                       | Known to Self | Unknown to Self |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Known to Others**   | Public        | Blind           |
| **Unknown to Others** | Secret        | Unconscious     |

This is known as the [Johari window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window), and it efficiently illustrates our relationship to self-awareness. The proportions between the four quadrants are different for everyone, but if your goal is to be fully aware of yourself and your reality, you must accept that there are parts of yourself that you are not yet aware of. I’m going to repeat that for emphasis: you are not fully aware of your entire self.

There’s no need to panic, however, and it may even bring you comfort to know that this is everyone’s experience. It’s a lifelong practice to get to know yourself. Depending on your goals, you might choose to make the unconscious quadrant smaller through, say, therapy, or tackle the blind quadrant by asking for feedback on your behavior from a close friend or colleague. The general insight that I hope this opens up is that _by definition_ our existence is one of imperfect self-awareness and knowledge. We are always presented with opportunities to be curious, ask why, and get to know ourselves a little better.

Before I go into how to put all of this into practice, you should know about another barrier to improved self-awareness. In general, more than 50% of people believe that they are above average, which is of course impossible. It’s been further shown that the _worse_ someone is at a particular skill, the more they tend to overrate their competence in that same skill.[^3](# "These are respectively known as [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) and the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect). There is no strong agreement on exactly why people behave this way, so for our purposes we can accept it as an empirical reality.") The broader consequences of this in modern society should be clear, but more importantly, I point this out because it’s likely that your own self-awareness is lower than you think it is, _especially_ if you believe that you already possess a high level of self-awareness! That might not be something you want to hear, but perhaps it’s comforting that everyone else is in the same boat.

If you feel resistance to the ideas you’ve been reading about in the last few paragraphs on self-awareness, that’s entirely understandable and expected. I’m approaching a subject that’s inherently threatening to your ego: your concept of who you are. The idea of “ego” is colloquially equated to arrogance or self-importance, but you can more precisely think about your ego as a collection of beliefs about yourself. This unique set of beliefs is what you consider to be “you” and is the basis of your identity. I use the word “beliefs” very deliberately because that is what they are: ideas that you choose to believe, both consciously and unconsciously.[^4](# "I’m going to side-step the mind-bending philosophical argument here, which is that if what you think of as “you” is just a set of beliefs, then who is the “you” without the beliefs? We’re sticking to the empirical realm here, and this concept of ego-as-beliefs holds true.") These ideas can be relatively simple (“I am reliable”, “I am generous”, “I don’t cry in public”, etc.) to more complex (what you believe it means to lead a good life, what roles you believe each gender should play in society, etc.), but however they are represented within us, the sum of these beliefs represent our model of who we believe we are in the world.

By questioning your level of self-awareness, you’re questioning the accuracy and basis of your self-beliefs, which in turn starts to threaten your sense of identity. The thought that you might not fully understand or be aware of who you think you are is uncomfortable for anyone. The ego’s response to this threat to your identity is to be highly self-protective. Thoughts or experiences that threaten the ego’s system of self-belief set off alarm bells. Your ego responds by springing into action with a range of counter-thoughts that seek to reinforce who you _already believe you are_ and reject anything that undermines that.

The simplest of these defenses is to reject contradictory information (“they’re wrong”, “they’re just trying to hurt me”, etc.), but our defenses can be remarkably complex and nuanced, often operating at an unconscious level. This is why improving self-awareness can be such a challenging process. Your sense of identity is intrinsically resistant to any change, making it a very unwilling partner to self-discovery. If you choose to do the work of becoming more self-aware, you’ll need to learn to embrace that irony.



We can now return to the bold claim I opened with.
