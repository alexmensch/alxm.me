I answered the question “[What is it like to be in a plane crash?](http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-in-a-plane-crash/answer/Alex-Marshall-2)” on Quora today. My answer is a slightly different perspective on what I’ve already written about as I tried to describe what it was like to go through the experience in a more factual and concise way than the story I’ve told [here](/writing/2010/12/02/mayday-mayday-for-sierra-lima/).
