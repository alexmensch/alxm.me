It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm a creative, empathetic soul who lives in London, and this is a collection of my creations and thinking. From writing to artwork to electronic circuit designs to tech startup consulting, I really appreciate both breadth of experience across different disciplines and the delightful, unexpected interactions between them.

what makes me happy? I delight in getting to know people and creating new experiences...
