Within these pages you'll find a sampling of my interests across a variety of different subjects. Creation and discovery are my primary drivers, which together have shaped the choices in my life. From writing to electronic circuits to artwork to founding a company, I've enjoyed the range of experience across different disciplines and the delightful, often unexpected, interactions between them. I currently live in London, and I consider Europe to be my childhood home.

Growing up, I lived in four countries across two continents. These formative experiences had a huge impact on my life outlook and how I relate to the world. I learned early on that what we may consider to be objectively correct is often only a jointly-held perspective. This is probably one of the underpinnings of the joy I get from meeting new people and getting to know and understand their perspectives and experiences.

On the creative side, I approach a new subject by going deep and working to understand the essence and the why of something. Aesthetically, I appreciate clean lines and simple forms; to me, these are visual manifestations of the same style of intellectual search. I credit my curiosity to an early exposure by my father to science and the wonder of the natural world. If you're looking to design something new, nature probably already has.

What you'll find here is a broad, roughly organized collection of my creations and thinking. I've built this as much for myself and its own sake (another creative project!) as for any audience that I can expect to land here. I hope you'll have the experience of learning something new or unexpected.
