layout: layouts/landing
title: Contact
hero: 
  header: Get in touch with me

Options:
- Email me
- Book a call
- Connect on LinkedIn

Each option has a nice button at the bottom. Email in the email case, but a "Book a call" button as the most enticing one, and then a LinkedIn button for the third one.

(Make some nice boxes -- thin border with secondary color, and an offset dotted shadow in the same color as the text / background of the footer)
