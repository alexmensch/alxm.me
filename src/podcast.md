This is a collection of my writing on various topics that I’m interested in, from my adventures while traveling to aviation to psychology. I most enjoy writing from a personal perspective, sharing my experiences and observations of the world.

I deeply appreciate writing as a mechanism for organizing thinking on a subject. Part of this comes from many years as a product manager in the software industry, where writing is the role’s primary form of influence. It’s also a great litmus test for clarity of thinking on a subject. Paul Graham’s advice on [writing simply](https://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) resonates strongly with me, and I aim to edit for both clarity and a natural cadence in the language.
