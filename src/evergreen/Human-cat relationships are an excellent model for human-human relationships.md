Cats are an excellent model for human relationships. The common complaint is that cats “do whatever they want”, but this comes from the viewpoint that a pet is always supposed to do exactly what the human owner wants. If this is the desire of the owner, then they shouldn’t expect this level of compliance from cats as pets. Domesticated dogs are bred for a high level of obedience amongst other traits, but this is not the case for cats.

However, when a cat is loved and respected as having its own needs and independence, the relationship that develops can be very mutual. The best part is that it’s an earned loved from the animal, received because of how the animal has been treated, not out of a need for validation. This makes the relationship very special and the bond stronger.

This a wonderful model for loving relationships between humans, too, balancing the need for independence, intimacy, and compromise, leading to a feeling of safety between people in a relationship.
