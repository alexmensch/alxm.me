Cats find it irresistible to pounce on toys just before they go out of view. They will watch play items intently as they are moved around, but bringing a toy to the edge of their visibility very often results in them attacking the item.

I don’t know for sure if this is the reason for cats’ behavior, but I noticed something in “nature” while walking around on the London underground that might be a clue. The platform was quiet, and a very small mouse was surprised as I walked onto the platform and it ran to a known hiding place. I saw it crawl into a tiny little space and then stood there quietly for a moment to see what would happen. After 20-30 seconds, it peeked out quickly to see if I was still there, and seeing me, quickly receded again. This seems very similar to the type of play that gets cats excited, and it seems like a likely explanation.
