From playing with my cats using a ribbon toy or other small objects they chase (eg. fake mice, balls, or springs), they seem to particularly enjoy anticipation when chasing.

Constantly moving the ribbon or toy around will engage their attention, but it does not appear to entice them to pounce as much as deliberately changing the tempo. Moving the ribbon and then pausing it, or making small movements of the ribbon really get them excited. You can often see them watching the toy intently and then when I stop any motion, they'll stare with wide pupils and start to
wiggle their back feet, getting ready to pounce.
