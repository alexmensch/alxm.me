I work with CEOs, founders, and senior executives who want to maximize their leadership potential. My coaching does not directly focus on how to exceed targets, maximize your team’s output, or reduce attrition, but these are the results that you can expect through the work you’ll do with me.

My approach focuses on how to build strong, enduring relationships with the people in your business. By fostering authentic relationships, your team will be more productive and effective than you thought possible. As a leader that people will want to follow, you’ll earn their genuine loyalty both now and in the future. You’ll also have a lot more fun.

I work 1:1 with clients on a weekly basis during regular London working hours. If you’d like to learn more, please get in touch at coaching@alexmarshall.me.
