### What am I looking for?

If you're someone with any of the below skills, I'd love your collaboration to help polish and launch a new interview-style podcast. I interview people who share intimate stories of major changes in their life, and their experiences are as inspiring as they are varied, from career changes to mental health challenges to spiritual journeys.

The great news is that I’ve already recorded interviews with all of the guests, so it’s a certainty that the first season of this podcast will launch, it’s just a question of when. That’s where you come in!

I'd love help with any of the following:

- **Audio engineering**: Consistent sound quality between episodes; compensating for environmental differences on the guest side; pacing and speech cleanup.
- **Music**: Theme and transition music composition.
- ~~**Artwork**: Podcast cover artwork; other marketing visuals.~~<br/>--> _Found someone to help, thank you [Dan Hollick](https://alcohollick.com)!_
- **Marketing**: Spreading news of the launch; episode show notes; uploading to various podcast platforms.
- **Miscellaneous**: Helping to name the podcast, finding additional guests if needed, validating edited episodes with guests, and anything else that comes up!

### Who am I?

I [used to run](/advisory) creative teams in the tech world, and I will be starting training as a [psychotherapist](/writing/2025/06/17/a-personal-biography/) this autumn. The topic of personal change is close to my heart as someone who has also made significant [life changes](/about).

### Who are you?

I’d love to work with anyone who’s passionate about the subject of change, has any of the skills needed to finish launching the podcast, and is interested in content creation. You’ll be joining me and my friend and collaborator [Katarina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarinapodlesnaya/) on the project. We’ll have fun doing it, and you’ll be fully credited on the project.
