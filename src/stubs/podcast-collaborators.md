title: "Looking for podcast collaborators!"
---

I’m looking for collaborators to help polish and launch a new interview-style podcast. In the podcast, I interview people who share intimate stories of major changes in their life, and their experiences are as inspiring as they are varied.

The great news is that I’ve already recorded interviews with all of the guests, so it’s a certainty that the first season of this podcast will launch, it’s just a question of when. That’s where you come in! I’m looking for one or more people to help with any or all of the following:

- Audio engineering: Consistent sound quality between episodes; compensating for environmental differences on the guest side; pacing and speech cleanup.
- Music: Theme and transition music composition.
- Artwork: Podcast cover artwork; other marketing visuals.
- Marketing: Spreading news of the launch; episode show notes; uploading to various podcast platforms.
- Miscellaneous: Helping to name the podcast, finding additional guests if needed, validating edited episodes with guests, and anything else that comes up!

I used to run creative teams in the tech world, and I will be starting training as a psychotherapist this autumn. The topic of personal change is close to my heart as someone who has also made significant life changes.

I’d love to work with anyone who’s passionate about the subject, has any of the skills needed to finish launching the podcast, and is interested in content creation. You’ll be joining me and my friend and collaborator [Katarina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarinapodlesnaya/) on the project. We’ll have fun doing it, and you’ll be fully credited on the project. You can get in touch with me at either [hello@alexmarshall.me](mailto:hello@alexmarshall.me) or +44 7492 950035 on WhatsApp or iMessage.
