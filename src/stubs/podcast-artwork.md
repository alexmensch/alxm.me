### Style

This is the prep that I gave my guests before we started recording:

_Imagine telling your story to your closest friend, someone who you know cares about you deeply and accepts you unconditionally. They care about your feelings, and they want to hear the details about what it was like to go through your journey without judgement._

_The tone I’m setting in the interviews is one that’s introspective, intimate, vulnerable, and proceeds at a calm, gentle pace. There’s no rush to get through it, and we’re here to witness the totality of you as a person as you tell your story: body, heart, and mind, exploring each as it makes sense in the conversation._

That, along with listening to some or all of an episode, will give you a good sense on the style and mood of the podcast.

In terms of visual style, I always enjoy general simplicity. Some example podcast artwork that I appreciate:
- [The General Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/0QWmlE9N8pcfWaj8eUvk8b) was actually created by Zach Johnston's wife, and the style is really cool. Kind of retro but also modern-ish? Each episode also has different artwork, which I'll cover later on.
- [One Simple Question](https://open.spotify.com/show/3Cy8Zwc74SIZd2eUWJjuFQ) is a podcast a friend of mine ran some time back. Also really simple, though I think some color would be better than monochrome. The feel of my podcast is emotionally warm, so it should I think also look warm.
- [Tetragrammaton](https://open.spotify.com/show/6ZVBi4NU0OmUT8fPomahis) is a bit too trippy for this podcast, but I like the emphasis on the name only.

### Platform requirements

The technical requirements are:
- 3000 x 3000 pixels
- PNG
- No alpha channel, no transparency

Only one image is a hard requirement, which is the [Show Cover](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5514-show-cover-template) that will be used for every episode. (Note that for The General Podcast, for example, they are using different artwork for each episode. We could do that here, too, perhaps using the name of the guest or the title of the episode, but I don't think that's very necessary right now unless you have an idea you're excited about.)

### Listen to an episode

If it's helpful, to get a sense for the feel of the show, this is [an episode](/podcast/felix-felix-findet-frieden/) you can listen to, which jumps right into Felix's story.(This link and the feed are not public.) Finalized episodes will have an introduction from me before the story starts and music composed for the podcast.
