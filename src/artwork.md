I trained as a fine artist at [London Fine Art Studios](https://londonfineartstudios.com), where I continue to study and improve my skills. Amongst the traditional techniques, I'm most drawn to figure, still life, and landscape. All paintings below are oil on cotton or linen canvas, and drawings are either charcoal or graphite. Sizes range from 8"x6" to 20"x30".
