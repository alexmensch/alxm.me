Below is a collection of my writing on a variety of topics that I'm interested in, from my adventures while traveling to aviation and psychology. I most enjoy writing from a personal perspective, sharing experiences I've had and my observations on the world. I write sporadically, most often when a topic really grabs my attention and compells me to condense and clarify my thoughts into words.

I deeply appreciate writing as a mechanism for organizing thinking on a subject. Part of this comes from many years as a product manager in the tech industry, where writing is the role's primary form of influence. It's also a great litmus test for clarity of thinking on a subject. Paul Graham's advice on [writing simply](https://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) resonates strongly with me, and I make an effort to edit both for clarity and a natural cadence in the language.

Typography and typesetting, the process of rendering and organizing writing, have long been of interest to me. I love the various intersections between art and science. We read so much on a daily basis that we take for granted the creativity behind the scenes that goes into typefaces and setting them out in such a way as to be both pleasing to the eye and easy to read. Movable type, the original precursor to digital typefaces, is an art form that goes back nearly 1,000 years.

This site uses Rasmus Andersson's [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) typeface for its clean lines, clarity across a wide range of sizes, and intentional design for use on digital devices. Any crudeness in the typesetting is entirely my fault.
