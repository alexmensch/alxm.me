A collection of my writing on a variety of topics, from international travel to aviation and psychology. I enjoy writing from a personal perspective, with the goal of either sharing unsual experiences or in the hope that the reader will learn something new. I write sporadically, but most often when a topic really grabs my attention and compells me to put my thoughts down in written form.
