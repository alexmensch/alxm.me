Below is a collection of my writing on a variety of topics, from international travel to aviation and psychology. I enjoy writing from a personal perspective, with the goal of either sharing unsual experiences or in the hope that the reader will learn something new. I write sporadically, but most often when a topic really grabs my attention and compells me to put my thoughts down in written form.

I deeply appreciate writing as a mechanism for organizing one's thinking. Part of this comes from many years as a product manager in the tech industry, where writing is the role's primary form of influence, but it's also a great litmus test for clarity of thinking on a subject. I really appreciate Paul Graham's timeless advice on [writing simply](https://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html).

Typography and typesetting, the process of rendering and organizing writing, has been a long-term fascination of mine. I love the intersections between art and science. We read so much on a daily basis that we take for granted the creativity behind the scenes that goes into typefaces and setting them out in such a way as to be both pleasing to the eye and easy to read. I can't claim to be an expert in either, but I'm using Rasmus Andersson's beautiful [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) typeface, and I hope that you'll forgive the crudeness of the typesetting tools available to me in favor of the words I've managed to string together.
