Below is a collection of my writing on various topics that I'm interested in, from my adventures while traveling to aviation to psychology. I most enjoy writing from a personal perspective, sharing experiences I've had and my observations on the world.

I deeply appreciate writing as a mechanism for organizing thinking on a subject. Part of this comes from many years as a product manager in the tech industry, where writing is the role's primary form of influence. It's also a great litmus test for clarity of thinking on a subject. Paul Graham's advice on [writing simply](https://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) resonates strongly with me, and I aim to edit both for clarity and a natural cadence in the language.

I love the intersection between art and science around typography and typesetting, the process of rendering and organizing writing. We read so much every day that we take for granted the creativity behind the scenes that goes into typefaces and setting them out in such a way as to be both pleasing to the eye and easy to read. Movable type, the original ancestor to digital typefaces, is an art form that goes back nearly 1,000 years.

This site uses Rasmus Andersson's [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) typeface for its clean lines, clarity across a wide range of sizes, and intentional design for use on digital devices. Any crudeness in the typesetting is entirely my fault.
